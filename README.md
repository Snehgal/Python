Here's a few mini-projects/code snippets I coded using Python in the early stages of my learning. 

my_module.[y: contains various commonly used techniques and functions like generating fibonnaci numbers, searching and sorting algorithms etc. I plan to enhance these codes as I learn along and make then more efficient using backtracking techniques and such, but for now they exist as a testament to my learning.

chess_moves.py: is a code to find the possible moves of a chess piece given its coordinates on the chess board. All pieces except the Knight are included here. I plan to extend the code to cover the Knight soon.
