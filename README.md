Here's a few mini-projects/code snippets I coded using Python in the early stages of my learning. 

my_module.py: contains various commonly used techniques and functions like generating Fibonacci numbers, searching and sorting algorithms, etc. I plan to enhance these codes as I learn along and make them more efficient using backtracking techniques and such, but for now, they exist as a testament to my learning.
Included functions are : 
1. Fibonacci number generator
2. Palindrome generator
3. Solution to Tower of Hanoi problem of n discs
4. Merging to sorted lists to produce a sorted list
5. Generating Pascal's Triangle upto n rows
6. Binary search algorithm
7. Merge Sort Algorithm
8. Bubble Sort Algorithm
9. Selection Sort Algorithm
10. Insertion Sort Algorithm
11. Check if a number is a power of another
12. Ceaser Cipher Encoder
13. Ceaser Cipher Decoder
14. Variable Length Decimal to Binary Converter
15. Fixed Length Decimal to Binary Converter
    
chess_moves.py: is a code to find the possible moves of a chess piece given its coordinates on the chess board. All pieces except the Knight are included here. I plan to extend the code to cover the Knight soon.
